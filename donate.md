### Where Does My Money Go?

We allocate your donation as follows:

|Allocation | Account|
|-------|--------|
|20% | Savings |
|30% | Income account |
|50% | Growth account |

$2,000 invested last year would have looked like this:

#### Savings

$400 would have gone to savings

Gain: None

#### Income Account

$600 would have gone to our income account. 

**Allocation:**

- 60% FXNAX  
- 5% FNBGX  
- 3% SWRSX  
- 6% VEGBX  
- 6% VWEAX  
- 20% VMRXX

Last year the returns would have been about 3.45%.

$600 × 1.0345 (3.45%) = $620.70

Gain: +$20.70

This would have paid for our domain name.{: .notice}

#### Growth Account

$1,000 would have gone to our growth account.

**Allocation:**

- 65% FSKAX

$1,000 × 1.216 (21.6%) = $1,216.00

Gain: +$216.00

This would have paid for all of our annual and biennial expenses.{: .notice }
