## Where Does My Money Go?

We allocate your donation as follows:

|Allocation | Account|
|-------|--------|
|20% | Savings |
|30% | Income account |
|50% | Growth account |

$2,000 invested last year would have looked like this:

### Savings Account

$400 would have gone to savings, which would have more than covered our annual and biennial expenses. 

**Gain:** None

### Income Account

$600 would have gone to our income account, and the growth would have paid for our domain name.

*Allocation:*

- 60% FXNAX  
- 5% FNBGX  
- 3% SWRSX  
- 6% VEGBX  
- 6% VWEAX  
- 20% VMRXX

Last year the returns would have been about 3.45%.

$600 × 1.0345 (3.45%) = $620.70

**Gain:** +$20.70

### Growth Account

$1,000 would have gone to our growth account. We do not mess with anything in this account without special board approval. 

*Allocation:*

- 65% FSKAX  
- 25% FSPSX  
- 10% FPADX

Last year the returns would have been about 21.6%.

$1,000 × 1.216 (21.6%) = $1,216.00

**Gain:** +$216.00
