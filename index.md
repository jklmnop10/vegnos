Vegnos is a nonprofit dedicated to exploring the implications of non-human or extraterrestrial intelligences. [Learn more &#x300B;](/about)

### Developing Projects

* We aim to produce a monograph by 2028 arguing that reality is intelligently created and managed by non-human intelligences.

* We hope to propose one or more exopolitical models that give a general picture of what exopolitics looks like in the contemporary world (or "contemporary" with quotes --- there's time travel!).

* We plan to compile a master reading list (annotated bibliography) of the best books available on each of the primary topics behind the alien reality.
