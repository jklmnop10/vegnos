Vegnos is a nonprofit dedicated to exploring the implications of non-human or extraterrestrial intelligences. [Learn more &#x300B;](/about)

### Developing Projects

* We aim to produce a monograph by 2028 arguing that reality is intelligently created and managed by non-human intelligences. The monograph should demonstrate to reasonably educated people that aliens almost certainly exist and almost certainly manage human affairs without actually showing physical proof, mainly by drawing connections between esoteric knowledge, history, and governance models. 

<!-- [Read the draft notes](/alien-reality) and if you like them, [donate](/donate). -->

* We hope to propose one or more exopolitical models usable by modern states. The models should give a general picture of what exopolitics looks like in a secular modern world and what, precisely, is at stake in planning for the new world order. 

* We hope to compile a master reading list (annotated bibliography) of the best books available on each of the primary topics behind the alien reality.
