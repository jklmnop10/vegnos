**Vegnos** (pronounced */vɛɡnoʊs/*) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that explores how non-human and extraterrestrial intelligences shape human history, power, and society. We reveal the hidden patterns behind myth, ritual, and cosmology to help make sense of the deeper structures that influence reality.

### What We Study

* **Non-Human and Extraterrestrial Intelligences** --- We investigate entities beyond human perception that may impact human evolution, society, and spiritual development. 

* **Esoteric and Mystical Traditions** --- Vegnos examines Hindu and Buddhist cosmology (Kalachakra, pralayas), Kabbalah (partzufim, shemot, olamot), Gnostic frameworks (root races, logoi, and rounds), and Christian mystical teachings, especially where hidden or secret knowledge is preserved. We also research marginal esoteric texts, lodge papers, runic systems, and other unpublished or fringe sources.
  
* **Historical Secret Societies and Occult Knowledge** --- We outline networks, hierarchies, and mystical interpretations of power that demonstrate the ways esoteric knowledge has been maintained, concealed, and transmitted through history.

### Our Approach

Vegnos integrates these areas of study to reveal how occult knowledge and historical esotericism reveal a distinct truth: aliens create and manage our reality!
