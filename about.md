Vegnos (pronounced /vɛɡnoʊs/) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that explores how non-human and extraterrestrial intelligences shape human history, power, and society. We reveal the hidden patterns behind myth, ritual, and cosmology to help make sense of the deeper structures that influence reality.
