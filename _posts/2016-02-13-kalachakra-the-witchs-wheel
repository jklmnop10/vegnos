The purpose of this page is to make it obvious that reality is created and managed by non-human intelligences. It is a prequel to our planned 2028 monograph, _The Structure of the Alien Reality_. None of it qualifies as "proof," but the overall picture painted and the nature of the connections outlined should convince most reasonable people of the alien reality and the nature of the alien reality. 

This page is a work-in-progress, and **a primary reason for our fundraising is to create the time to finalize it and its associated monograph.** If you like the contents of this page, please consider [donating to Vegnos](/donate).

### Contents

First explain kalachakra: what it is generally and the core conflict surrounding it. In explaining the core conflict we describe as best we can the non-material realm and the two Her-Him tantras. Explain that the Ain Sof of the Hebrew kabbalah is roughly equivalent to Her. Situate current humanity within a cyclic model of time. Explain that the current phase of creation and its history can only be understood with reference to previous periods of creation, including the polar-hyperborean phases (roughly equivalent in Biblical esotericism to Genesis 1:1), the Lemurian phase (the Garden of Eden and the pre-flood world), and the Atlantean phase (the pre-flood world). The wheel of time that we live in and its associated Her-Him tantra is the product of one faction of hyperboreans, and the core conflict surrounding kalachakra is between hyperboreans. Hyperboreans are equivalent to the reptilians or occult dragons, representing the highest level of occult initiation, so this information will not become entirely clear until the end. Explain that most conspiracies are all true in some way, that their status as conspiracy is part of the intentional design of the culture, and that kalachakra initiation explains them all eventually.

Next explain the sciences of kalachakra, "the three kabbalahs" These are *eastern,* represented by hinduism and buddhism, *western,* represented by Greek platonism and the Hebrew Kabbalah, and *runic* or Northern. Explain that the racial correspondences are not an accident and hint that the Her-Him tantras come with secret sex magick doctrines regarding races and the creation of races. Explain that the core of the "Sacred Science" is sex tantra and sex magick, the basis of all generation, including the generation of cosmic, material manifestations like the one we live in. Give a brief schematic of the Hebrew science of the wheel of time: that the gift of kingship, the secret of Hockmah, is the final gift of kalachakra; that all the lower sefirot provide the science of kalachakra, culminating in Binah, or Saturn, ruler of time, and Shabbat, or how Binah, the mother, cares for Zeir Anpin; that the lower kabbalah or lower kalachakra culminates in Zeir Anpin, or YHVH, who has 72 names, and that this is the typical stopping point of esoteric initiation, representing the "lower dragon." The mating between Zeir Anpin and Nukvah, malchut, describe most of the initial science. Below that, "underneath the stars" that subject the nations to fate, there is the exoteric kalachakra wheel of twelve houses, seven planets, and three elements, or the klippothic world that we live in, on whom Israel is trying to do "tikkun olam" to perfect the Her-Him tantra (Ain Sof is equivalent to Lakshmi or Her). Again suggest that the Hebrew race as a race of special note is unsurprising given the secret racial doctrines of kalachakra and the root of the Sacred Science being about race and gender, that is to say, about sex. 

Woah, that's a lot of information all at once. It's probably changed your life already! [Donate](/donate)

Next, explain the core group behind the wheel of time tantra, the A.A. (Arcanum Arcanorum), and its system of initiation. Explain the role the Elders and Chiefs on Saturn have planned for Crowley and what Crowley did, occultically, with the A.A. Contrast the A.A. system of initiation with the runic system, which is opposed to kalachakra and the hyperboreans who started the A.A., that this conflict with runic initiation will be a main drama when the alien reality is more openly acknowledged. Explain that Saturn is the source of the bulk of the conflicts *within* the A.A. (unlike the runic, which comes from without), and give an overview of Saturn philosophies opposing Hebrew Shabbat, such as those practiced by the Catholic Israel system ("true Israel"), or those proposed by the Fraternitatis Saturni. Finally explain the pre-Crowley A.A.'s grand design under the Jewish-Catholic system, the plans these have for the second coming of Jesus, the proposals from some of the adepts, initiates, and chiefs of the A.A. for a system that does not depend on mashiach, and why these proposals *must* be planed opposition by the Chiefs and the Elders due to the requirements of the kabbalah and the core tantra. 

I'm just going to go ahead and say we have already proved the alien reality! That deserves a [donation](/donate)

Explain monarchy as *the core* social system of kalachakra, along with the "Israel systems," a kind of socialism for kings. Hockmah as representing the gift of kalachakra, which is kingship. Explain this as a material imitation of an even higher kingship rooted in the Hebrew phrase "ana emloch," I will reign; that the klippot, through the kings of edom, reveal the ability to become a creator of cosmic manifestations like this one, that the depends on the tantra with Her/Ain Sof/Lakshmi. Explain that there is the lower dragon at the tiferet sign, the full Christ (ben David) and the beginning of the path of Ascended Masters or Christs and Buddhas; and then there is the upper dragon at the supernals, Keter-Hockmah-Binah-Daat. Explain that the lower dragons are kings on earth but have only a kind of knighthood compared to the kingship of hockmah. Project MONARCH. Contrast all this with the runic system. Mention secret racial doctrines again and point out the role of bloodlines in the monarchy as well as new world order systemd. Explain that the old world order systems of the church, the monarchy, and Israel *are* the "galactic federation," and that the original systems were geocentric for a reason. Point out that the switch to heliocentrism was something in the way of the higher dragons playing with the cosmology for symbolic and doctrinal shifts. Give some ways the dragons play with and through history, such as St. Germain's incarnational exploits or the exploits of less obviously regal historical figures. Include their activities on other planets and at other times. Give the runic opposition to the kalachakra system of kingship, how its theory of sovereignty relies on the belief in the supremacy of the spirit and is closer to the "ana emloch" mentioned before; also mention the role the nations and klippotic aspects have to play. Point out that the klippotic aspects look very different from the perspective of the Hebrew kabbalah versus the perspective of the uncreated spirit, and that the hyperborean conflict involves very complex subjects, but that both systems are totally opposed but each totally integrated, true, and logical systems; that the propaganda from both obscures this.

Explain the role states have to play in relation to the more transcendentally coherent monarchy systems. Argue that states are both corporately autonomous of monarchies and still exceptionally dependent on them. Give an overview of the role the Chiefs and Elders played in the founding and formation of the Americas and the similar but opposing runic and English projects. Explain that the nature of creation means that the spiritual hierarchies that blend into the deep or esoteric state include both heaven and hell, and have to continue to include both indefinitely because of the kabbalah. Reiterate that heaven and hell hierarchies look very different from the perspective of the non-material spirit versus the perspective of material creation; that "hell's" basic argument is that matter and the creations of the the dragons are not redeemed except in a superficial sense, and that in relation to the timeless spirit these time schemes are something of a swindle. Explain the nature of the core conflict around kalachakra and how it plays out in the deep state. Explain other dramas within the deep state, such as between Catholics, Protestants, and Masons, as well as the role non-Christian or Jewish witchcraft plays. Explain the way the lodge system, the coven system, and the Catholic Provincial system govern day to day life within the wheel of time, at the level of the exoteric state. Explain the the secular Illuminati was originally an imitation of the Catholic Provincial system of governance, which more directly blends into the spiritual administration of the wheel of time. Explain the masonic "Magisterium" mythos and the role Masonry plays in the old world order's grand design, including the second coming. Cover the handful of major criminal enterprises that make it through the deep state into the spiritual hierarchy, including drug running and human trafficking, and how they exploit the management system for reality to remain a conspiracy or to stay highly classified. Explain the role the moon, or the power of Yesod, has in the regulation of time, how this relates to Catholic chronovisor conspiracies, and how crucial it is in state-level management of time separate from the Church. Explain the joke the dragons orchestrated when they invited the new world into the time management system by having them land on the moon. Hint at the similar critical role Saturn will play in the new world order. Explain the general kabbalistic basis of finance, how it is an outgrowth of the original scarcity, or tzimtzum, required for creation; draw the parallels between criticisms of finance and runic criticisms of the Her-Him tantra that locks timeless spirits into cosmic manifestations (space-time).

Finally point out that even intuitive conclusions, some of which may even be propagated in the culture, turn out to be dead wrong. Consider: "It turns out that after the initial shock, the planned events, and the possible [ragnarok] it won't necessarily amount to much for the common person. He or she may not have known it, but life was structured by the alien reality all along. There may not be much more change than an announcement of an official and public secret space program, and the release of official, state-sanctioned ascension manuals. On the corporate and state side, after the newcomers' energy dies out, the standard kalachakra regulations will already be adequate to deal with most issues and will be applied. Any criminal issues thet have made it to the top, such as drug trade, will continue to be problems into the future but probably not at any new level of seriousness." Explain how this misunderstands the true nature of time and this is largely because of the way time is taught as history. Explain that the person who lives through this reality exists on a very low level of reality designed to keep them locked out of larger cycles; that if they were to be initiated to the level of the Mahabharata war, regardless of what is planned and deployed in the cultures designed to stay at a certain level of knowledge, etc. Again creation functions off of a scarcity, a lack. Most of the supernal systems for how to drip knowledge, etc, into the scarcity are governed at their core by the kabbalah of creation --- it is *literally* true that every hair on your head and every crater on the moon is accounted for. But most governance systems permit quite a bit of lattitude in how the priviledged castes of reality management can treat or use or handle the levels at which anything like "Disclosure" needs to happen (source of the "goy" conspiracies). So "the culture" settling at "a historical narrative" is a way of keeping most of the individuals within that culture psychically bound to only one cross section of reality. "At its base it is about tending to the cosmocreator's desires, he creates the reality." "This is not true, the whole system is founded on..." "Because they can *create* the reality" "Yes but when you create a reality, reality has its own god independent of the cosmocreators, the system is "in itself" worship of this god, the lattitude you can take inside the creation with the creatures is secondary and even prohibited. Even very high level initiated deny this, think it is just a game of lamaism or masonry or satanism." "And it is, it depends on, its such a high level question, it depends on choice, right, the way choice exists or doesn't exist when the dragon creates your reality, which is the relationship between keter and daat. So to answer here gets very technical and the outcome is that the system prioritizing the spirit definitely wins, hands down, and from up there it's even obvious that what the kalachakra people are doing is not the thing to do! So we are stuck here with an echo..." "I mean the ones who oppose it are definitely harmful to the creatures, not the creature's spirits which is the point but the creatures themselves, but then thats the point. But the creatures need the blood economy system to protect them, the blood of Jesus or the other blood systems can do it, but without these systems of sacrifice or substitute sacrifice demanded by reality, the god of creation generated when the dragons cosmocreate, it needs these systems to protect the creatures, so we can't just let them in because they won the argument, we are still *in* the situation. And there's something to be said that we *can* do it from the non-material, it makes the in itself system, you can oppose what grows off of it, but the core system it makes it..."
